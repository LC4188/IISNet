# <h1> Clarity in Chaos: Boosting Few-Shot Classification through Information Suppression and Sparsification 
# <h3> Abstract
The advance of deep learning has invigorated the research of few-shot classification. However, the interference of non-target information in feature representations hampers classification generalization. To tackle this issue, we propose an irrelevant information suppression (IIS) module, which is focused on it suppressing the weight of unimportant information and elevating the sparsity of feature representations. An IIS network with three consecutive IIS modules is developed, to illustrate the progressive suppression of unimportant information and highlighting of key discriminative features of the target. Extensive experiments showcase the superior performance of our IIS network on four widely-used benchmark datasets. Furthermore, we show that the IIS module can be readily used as a plug-in module by state-of-the-art few-shot classifiers, and can clearly further improve their performance.<br>

# Change your dataset_dir
You need to cd /IISNet-main/common/utils.py ,to change the "-data_dir" to your dataset_dir.

# Training the code 
```cd /IISNet-main/train/xxx.sh <br>
Please set the gpu id which you want to run,then run the file such as "bash aircraft_5w1s.sh".<br>
```
# Testing the code 
```cd /IISNet-main/test/xxx.sh <br>
Please set the gpu id which you want to run,then run the file such as "bash cars_5w5s.sh".
